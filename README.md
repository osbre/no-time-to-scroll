Many website-blocking or "focus" extensions show pop-ups and do all sorts. I wanted something simple and minimal that does one thing well.

Works with Reddit, Twitter (X), Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok out of box.

# Installation (as you would any other)

1. `git clone git@github.com:osbre/no-time-to-scroll.git`

2. Open `chrome://extensions/`, enable **Developer mode**, then click **Load unpacked** and select the extension's folder.

3. Modify `rules.json` to your liking. (optional)
